    desc="Designed and executed solution architectures for Cloudera environments, leading the procurement and implementation of new hardware and software to enhance system capabilities. I also designed and developed ETL pipelines using Apache Spark and NiFi to support data ingestion and processing into the Data Lake. I was responsible for modifications and deployment of these pipelines from the QA environment to production (PROD). To strengthen security and simplify authorization, I integrated Cloudera with Kerberos using Active Directory. I installed and configured Cloudera services and ETL tools, ensuring optimal setup and performance across the platform. Additionally, I implemented and upgraded SSL certificates on all production nodes to enhance data security. My efforts included optimizing Kudu table performance and balancing HDFS and Kudu data loads to reduce latency and improve data processing efficiency. I also led the installation and integration of Cloudera NiFi, replacing Streamsets to streamline ETL processes and enhance data ingestion workflows."
