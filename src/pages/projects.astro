    desc="Designed and executed solution architectures for Cloudera environments, leading the procurement and implementation of new hardware and software to enhance system capabilities. I also designed and developed ETL pipelines using Apache Spark and NiFi to support data ingestion and processing into the Data Lake. I was responsible for modifications and deployment of these pipelines from the QA environment to production (PROD). To strengthen security and simplify authorization, I integrated Cloudera with Kerberos using Active Directory. I installed and configured Cloudera services and ETL tools, ensuring optimal setup and performance across the platform. Additionally, I implemented and upgraded SSL certificates on all production nodes to enhance data security. My efforts included optimizing Kudu table performance and balancing HDFS and Kudu data loads to reduce latency and improve data processing efficiency. I also led the installation and integration of Cloudera NiFi, replacing Streamsets to streamline ETL processes and enhance data ingestion workflows."

    desc="Developed and integrated a unified Customer 360 model, consolidating data from multiple source systems to generate key performance indicators (KPIs) aligned with business requirements. As part of a strategic initiative, I planned and implemented a data migration activity from the existing Oracle 19c CDB Plus warehouse to the Cloudera CDH 5.x-based Data Lake. I was responsible for user acceptance testing (UAT) of the data migrated from CDB to the Data Lake, ensuring accuracy and completeness. In addition, I led a team of highly technical professionals responsible for the development and maintenance of both production and disaster recovery (DR) sites for the client's Data Lake infrastructure. I modified Cloudera configurations to optimize service performance and job execution, including service-level tuning and YARN queue management. Furthermore, I assisted the client in migrating data and ETL logic for over 3,000 tables, stored procedures, and views to the Big Data Appliance (BDA), the current Data Lake platform. This migration included ingesting data from core systems such as T24 Temenos (core banking), as well as other key systems like Credit Card, IRIS, ATM, and more."
